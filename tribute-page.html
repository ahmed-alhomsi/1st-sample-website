          <h3>Some facts about the famous boxer and his style:</h3>
            <p>The boxing style of Ali was highly unorthodox for a heavyweight. He never relied on overpowering punches. Instead he relied on his superior hand speed, quick reflexes and constant movement. Ali often danced and circled around his opponents holding his hands low. This led to his opponents chasing him and throwing themselves off balance in an attempt to hit him as he appeared to be an open target. However they often missed and left them exposed to Ali’s counter punches. This was precisely how Sonny Liston was hit and knocked out by Ali in their second fight. Professional boxer Floyd Patterson said this about Ali’s movements: “It’s very hard to hit a moving target, and (Ali) moved all the time, with such grace, three minutes of every round for fifteen rounds. He never stopped. It was extraordinary.” Also, the strong footwork of Ali made it almost impossible for his opponents to cut down the ring and corner him against the ropes. The boxing style of Muhammad Ali is epitomized by his own catchphrase: “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”.
